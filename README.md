# SpeedRead

Welcome to my very first self-made project using a combination of HTML, CSS, and Java Script!

Because this is my first real project, I wanted to make a simple website that allows the user to read text at around 250+ words per minute. The user will be able to insert any text block they want and the text will be displayed in one spot of the screen one word at a time to optimize reading speed.

If you would like to know more about why I did this and how it works, please check out my slide deck! https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Ol_ar3d_QcNelWquWPgs4qsMPWHCKBHuFyMG-PxYknc/edit#slide=id.g8f4f65bf5d_0_1069
